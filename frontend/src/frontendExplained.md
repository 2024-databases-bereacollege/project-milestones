### Folders
src: This folder contains the source code for the frontend application. It includes the following subfolders:

components: This folder contains reusable UI components that are used throughout the application.
pages: This folder contains the different pages of the application, each representing a specific route or view.
styles: This folder contains CSS or SCSS files for styling the components and pages.
utils: This folder contains utility functions or helper classes that are used across the application.
services: This folder contains modules for interacting with backend APIs or external services.
assets: This folder contains static assets such as images, fonts, or other media files used in the application.
public: This folder contains static files that are served as-is by the web server. It typically includes the index.html file, which is the entry point for the frontend application.

config: This folder contains configuration files for the frontend application. It may include environment-specific configurations, build settings, or other project-specific settings.

tests: This folder contains test files for testing the frontend application. It may include unit tests, integration tests, or end-to-end tests.

Files
index.js: This file is the entry point for the frontend application. It typically renders the root component and mounts it to the DOM.

App.js: This file represents the main component of the application. It acts as a container for other components and manages the application's state and routing.

routes.js: This file defines the routes for the application. It maps URLs to specific components or pages.

constants.js: This file contains constant values used throughout the application, such as API endpoints, error messages, or configuration settings.

theme.js: This file defines the theme and styling variables used in the application. It may include colors, typography, or other design-related properties.
